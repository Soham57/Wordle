# Wordle Game

Wordle is a word-guessing game written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game requires the player to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. The game also includes a unique animation feature that provides feedback to the player in a fun and interactive way when they win or make a wrong choice of word.

## Gameplay

In Wordle, the player is given six chances to guess the secret five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player in the form of colored circles:

- A green circle represents a letter that is in the right place in the secret word.
- A yellow circle represents a letter that is present in the secret word but in the wrong place.

If the player is unable to guess the secret word within six attempts, they lose the game.

## How to Play

To start playing Wordle, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game is currently not responsive, so it is recommended to play the game on a desktop computer.

## Future Improvements

Some possible improvements to Wordle could include:

- Adding a feature to allow the player to choose the difficulty level of the game.
- Making the game responsive so that it can be played on mobile devices.
- Adding a scoring system to track the player's performance over multiple games.
- Adding more animations and sound effects to make the game more engaging.
